# FusorSim
HTML5 simulator/game that tracks ions in IEC fusion device.


Dev goals order of importance:
* Written in Javascript for low barrier to entry for development(may change if perf requires)
* Simulate Fenly Fusor first, perhaps other designs later.
* 3d Visualization to understand the working principle of the fusor.
* Controls to adjust fusor params,  E-field, B-field, deuterium pressure, etc.
* Gauges and strip chart to measure device performance.
* Run sim on gpu if possible
* Physical accuracy, this will be the most difficult. 


Written in HTML5 and js using canvas, d3.js, matter.js, three.js
